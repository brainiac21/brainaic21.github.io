This is Yinan Zhao's home.

* I am a Ph.D student in the [Astronomy Department](https://astro.ufl.edu/) at [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/), advised by Prof [Jian Ge](https://www.astro.ufl.edu/~jge/).
* My research focuses on the area of data intensive astronomy and machine learning, particularly in quasar absorption line systems and exoplanet detection with doppler spectroscopy. I'm also interested in general-purpose GPU programming and the origin of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Hebei Normal Univerisy in 2014. I obtained my Master's Degree in University of Florida in 2016.
